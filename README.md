The need for this repository came when I was unable to find a decent tutorial online to a jquery noob like me to generate dynamic html forms, mainly html forms requiring input.
Some useless tutorials include: <br>http://websistent.com/dynamic-textbox-jquery-php/ <br>
http://www.infotuts.com/insert-record-in-database-jquery-php/ <br>
http://www.sanwebe.com/2013/03/addremove-input-fields-dynamically-with-jquery <br>
http://jsfiddle.net/aaki/hMJEy/1/ (not so bad fiddle actually!)

I have tried to keep the code as simple as possible, comments are welcome at arpitjain099 AT gmail DOT com

The other part of the project deals with populating the quiz over an android handset to be used in classroom scenario. This part of code is taken from my existing code base at https://github.com/arpitjain099/class-quiz-android-app-generator
